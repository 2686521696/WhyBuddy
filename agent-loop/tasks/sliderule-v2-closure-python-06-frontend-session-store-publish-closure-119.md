# sliderule-v2-closure-python-06-frontend-session-store-publish-closure-119

## Execution status
- Status: DONE_REVIEWED
- Phase: 119-appbundle-runtime-closure
- Theme: python
- Owner: grok
- Reviewer: codex
- Landing: codex-reviewed-only
- Reference wave: 480-task 118 cross-runtime outputs

## Objective
Persist publish closure evidence in the frontend SlideRule session state without breaking older sessions.

## Context
This task is part of the 50-task AppBundle publish/runtime closure integration wave. Use the prior 118 cross-runtime task files, queue outcomes, and shard worktrees as reference material, but do not blindly apply generated patches. Grok may implement candidate code in the shard worktree; Codex will review, extract, test, and land only clean slices to main.

Focus on Python /drive-full schema and pass-through. Preserve degraded/error states and avoid provider calls.

- `agent-loop/scripts/sliderule-v2-cross-runtime-118-shard-*-queue.json`
- `.worktrees/sliderule-v2-cross-runtime-118-shard-*-run`
- Current main commits around AppBundle runtime closure and Skill linkage.

## Allowed files
- `client/src/lib/skills/**`
- `client/src/pages/sliderule/**`
- `client/src/pages/SlideRule.tsx`
- `slide-rule-python/**`

- `agent-loop/tasks/**`
- `agent-loop/scripts/**`

## Do not
- Do not edit `.env`, credentials, lockfiles, or unrelated runtime artifacts.
- Do not weaken existing tests, gates, or fail-closed semantics.
- Do not apply a raw 480-task patch wholesale.
- Do not mark done with markdown-only changes.
- Do not make network, DB, Redis, provider, or browser calls from pure Skill helpers.

## Required implementation
- [x] Add or update executable code, typed schema, fixture, adapter, or focused tests for the objective.
- [x] Preserve deterministic local behavior.
- [x] Include both positive evidence and fail-closed negative behavior where applicable.
- [x] Keep public API names stable or document any migration in the final report.
- [x] Add a concise final report listing changed files, exported symbols, and validation commands.

## Acceptance criteria
- The result is useful as candidate material for Codex review and main landing.
- The changed code is scoped to the objective and theme.
- Focused tests are added or updated when practical.
- Existing AppBundle publish/runtime closure semantics are not weakened.
- AgentLoop final report explains how this task advances publish/runtime closure.

## Codex Review Landing

Reviewed and landed as part of the Python `/drive-full` closure batch. `client/src/pages/sliderule/useSlideRuleSession.ts` preserves Python `publishClosure` through session save/load paths while old sessions without the field remain valid.

Validation:
- `npx vitest run client/src/pages/sliderule/__tests__/derive-persisted-turn.test.ts client/src/pages/sliderule/__tests__/derive-cross-runtime-summary.test.ts client/src/pages/sliderule/__tests__/ArchitectureProcessPanel.test.tsx client/src/pages/sliderule/__tests__/derive-status-bar.test.ts --reporter=dot` -> 4 files / 38 tests passed.

Public state shape remains backward compatible: missing `publishClosure` stays absent/undefined and does not fabricate green closure evidence.
